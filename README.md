👋 Hi, I'm Pablo! Transitioning from architecture to tech, I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer currently diving deep into React and JavaScript. My goal is to merge my design sensibilities with my technical skills to build innovative and user-friendly web applications.

🌍 Originally from Chile, my journey has led me across the globe from the tranquil beaches of Thailand to the eco-friendly habitats of Sri Lanka, where I managed a permaculture hostel and embraced the surf and yoga lifestyle.

🎯 Passionate about coding and problem-solving, I am always seeking challenges that push my boundaries and expand my horizons. When I'm away from the keyboard, I enjoy staying active with sports, strumming my guitar, and dreaming up my next big adventure.

🌱 Envisioning a future where I blend my love for tech with my commitment to sustainability by creating a natural Airbnb retreat. I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and teams to innovate and grow. Let’s make something impactful together!
